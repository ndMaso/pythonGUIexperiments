# pythonGUIexperiments
tkinter work for little games and math visualization. 
General programming ideas that involve or have added some visualization/interactivity from the tkinter module

Some components of the programs in addition to gui handling include:
  From Pachinko
  - implementations of differential equations + simple physics models 
  
  From FourierAnimation
  - generating an interpolating polynomial to an arbitrary amount of points
  - performing analytic integration of a few classes of functions
  
  From DDR
  - Recording real-time input from the keyboard
  - Preventing accumulating lag in time sensitive programs with a visual update loop.
  
  From VocabularyPractise
  - Manipulating datasets in pandas
